# Tobiloba Ayomide Portfolio

Welcome! This is my personal portfolio website, built from scratch to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information. I designed it to be modern, responsive, and easy to navigate, using the latest web technologies.

---

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here
- A clean, mobile-friendly interface with a purple accent theme and custom fonts
- Smooth navigation between Home, About, Projects, and Contact sections
- Project cards with images, tech badges, and live links
- A downloadable resume (PDF)
- A contact form that sends messages directly to my email
- Accessibility and responsive design throughout

---

## 🛠️ How I Built It
I started this project with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a fast React + TypeScript setup. I chose [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for layout and components, then layered in custom CSS for a unique look and feel. I paid special attention to:
- **Typography:** Imported and used custom fonts for a distinctive style
- **Color Scheme:** Used a purple accent for branding and visual interest
- **Responsiveness:** Made sure every section looks great on all devices
- **Accessibility:** Used semantic HTML, proper labels, and good contrast

## 📦 Running the Project Locally
If you want to see or modify the site on your own machine, here’s how:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio.git
   cd your-portfolio
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the development server**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to view the site.

## 🏗️ Project Structure (How Things Are Organized)
- `src/App.tsx` – The main React component, containing all sections and logic
- `src/App.css` – Custom styles for layout, colors, and responsiveness
- `src/assets/` – Images for project cards
- `public/resume.pdf` – My downloadable resume
- `public/t-logo.svg` – Custom favicon for branding

---

## 📝 How I Deployed It
Once I was happy with the design and content, I deployed the site using [Vercel](https://vercel.com):
1. Pushed my code to GitHub
2. Connected my repo to Vercel
3. Vercel automatically detected the Vite setup and built the site
4. Got a live URL to share with the world!

_You can also use Netlify, GitHub Pages, or Firebase Hosting if you prefer._

## ✏️ Customizing for Yourself
Want to use this as a template? Just:
- Update your info, skills, and project details in `App.tsx`
- Replace images in `src/assets/`
